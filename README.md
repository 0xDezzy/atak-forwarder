# ATAK Packet Forwarder 

An application/service for forwarding ATAK UDP packets via a hardware layer. Currently supports GoTenna Mesh.

# Setup

First you will need to set up your ATAK to send its mesh broadcasts to your localhost so that this application/service can receive and forward the messages, to do that:

Add a Loopback Output

Make sure Loopback Output is checked

* Copy the GoTenna Public SDK into the `gotenna-public-sdk/` folder as `gotenna-public-sdk.aar`
* Edit `MainActivity.java`, put your GoTenna SDK token in the `GOTENNA_SDK_TOKEN` variable
* Set `LATITUDE` and `LONGITUDE` to your approximate lat/lon, this is how the application determines which frequencies your GoTenna should use do DO NOT MISS THIS STEP!
* Set `PRIMARY_DEVICE` to `true` and build the application onto your first device
* Set `PRIMARY_DEVICE` to `false` and build the application onto your secondary device
* Open ATAK on each device

It will take quite a while for the first messages to be transmitted. During my testing I only tested in one direction -- having both devices transmit might take too much bandwidth for the GoTenna Mesh.

GoTenna Mesh doesn't have enough bandwidth to really work for this application, just sending a single position update takes ~1 min and isn't very reliable. It definitely won't work once you start drawing a bunch of bandits on the map.

The hardware/communication layer is abstracted behind a `CommHardware` interface, this interface can be implemented against other hardware -- I am going to try an XBee next, but if you would like to give it a shot with something else please reach out to me and let me know how it goes.
